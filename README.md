# Welcome to Moismail personal page

A minimal, static personal profile page designed to serve as a professional digital resume for backend engineers. 

This project was built to communicate depth and maturity through a "calm web" aesthetic, avoiding excessive animations or flashiness in favor of clarity, typography, and content. It groups complex backend skills (System Design, Databases, API Architecture) into a structured, readable format.

## Technologies Used

*   **React 18**: Built using modern functional components and hooks.
*   **Vite**: Utilized for lightning-fast development server and optimized production builds.
*   **Vanilla CSS + Variables**: No heavy UI frameworks (Bootstrap, Material UI, Tailwind) were used. Styling is handled via a custom CSS variable system defining a neutral "Stone/Gray" color palette and consistent spacing.
*   **Semantic HTML**: Accessible structure suitable for screen readers and SEO.
*   **Responsive Design**: A desktop-first layout that gracefully adapts to mobile screens.
